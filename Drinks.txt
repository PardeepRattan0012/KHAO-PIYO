Our Story

Our Story:
KHAO PIYO was founded by two students of LPU (PARDEEP RATTAN, ISHAN ARORA), an entrepreneur who began selling food from his roadside restaurant in LPU and Jalandhar, during the Great Depression. The idea of this website is inspired by our real-life incidents. KHAO PIYO popularized in the fast-food industry, diversifying the market by challenging the established dominance of the hamburger.
Our Mission:
At KHAO PIYO, our mission is to spread the joy of our world-famous foods to food lovers everywhere. We strive to:
Serve high-quality, great-tasting food at affordable prices
Provide exceptional customer service in a clean, welcoming environment
Be a positive force in our communities through job creation and community involvement
Our Commitment to Quality:
Every KHAO PIYO meal is prepared with real items, raised by trusted farmers who follow our strict quality and welfare standards. Our food is freshly prepared in-store by trained cooks. We're proud to say that we still follow hygiene and the best practices for pure items for our food.
